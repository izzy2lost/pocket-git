		<h3 id="manually">Importing a project manually</h3>
		
		<img src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_action_add.png" class="fab">
		<p>To import a project into Pocket Git, start by pressing the action 
		button in the initial activity.</p>

		<p>After that, choose a <strong>name</strong> for your project.</p> 
		<p>The <strong>repository URL</strong> can either use the SSH protocol, for example 
		<span class="url">git@github.com:user/project.git</span>, or the HTTP protocol, for example
		<span class="url">https://github.com/user/project.git</span>.</p>
		
		<p>The local path is the directory where the project will be created. You can choose it using
		the included directory selector. You can choose the initial directory for your projects in
		the settings.</p>
		
		<p>You can then choose three different forms of <strong>authentication</strong>: none, password and private key.</p> 
		
		<p><strong>None</strong> means you will be an anonymous user with little privileges.</p> 
		
		Picking <strong>password</strong>, you will have to set a username, and optionally a password. Leaving 
		the password field empty will make Pocket Git ask for it when needed.</p>
		
		Picking <strong>private key</strong> will allow you to select the path of your private key. If the private key 
		is <strong>passphrase</strong> protected, Pocket Git will ask for the passphrase when needed.</p>
		
		<img src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_action_save.png" class="actionbar">
		<p>When you're ready, press the <em>save</em> icon to save your new project. You will need to clone it first
		before using it.</p>
		
		<h3 id="github">Importing from github or bitbucket</h3>
		
		<p>If your project is hosted by <em>github</em> or <em>bitbucket</em>, you will simply have to
		use your browser to navigate to your project's <em>github</em> or <em>bitbucket</em> home. From there,
		share the page with Pocket Git. After that, you will be able to select between the HTTP and SSH protocols.</p>
		
		<p>Every field will be automatically filled except for the authentication.</p>
		
		<p>Sharing a github or bitbucket link for a project already imported will open the project or offer to clone the project instead.</p>
		
		<h3 id="cloning">Cloning a project</h3>
		
		<img src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_action_clone.png" class="listview">
		
		<p>A project that isn't already cloned will have a clone icon next to it. Pressing the project will initiate 
		a clone. If the local path isn't empty, you will be prompted before its contents are deleted.</p>

		<p>As the clone progresses, you will be able to see a notification informing you of the current state of the cloning:</p>

		<p>
			<img src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_action_clone" class="list">
			Project hasn't been cloned yet. Press it to clone it.
		</p>

		<p>
			<img src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_cloned" class="list">
			Project is already cloned. Press it to enter it.
		</p>

		<p>
			<img src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_cloning" class="list">
			Project is being cloned. You can follow its progress in a status bar notification.
		</p>

		<p>
			<img src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_failed" class="list">
			Project failed to clone. Press it to try cloning again.
		</p>

		<h3 id="#editing">Editing a file</h3>
		
		<p>After opening a project, you will see a list of files. You can navigate in the directory tree by pressing the directory names.</p>

		<p>To open a file for editing, simply press that file's name. You will be presented with a list of applications that can edit that file. 
		We recommend you give <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aor.droidedit.pro">DroidEdit</a> a try ;-)</p>

		<p>If changes to the file are saved, you will notice that the status of that icon changed. That means that the file as uncommitted
		changes. Before committing those changes, the file needs to be staged.</p>

		<h3 id="staging">Staging changes</h3>

		<p>After changing a file, you need to stage the change before committing it. To do this, first do a long press on the file name until
		the action mode bar appears. Then select the <em>stage</em> icon.</p>

		<p>The possible action icons in the action mode bar are the following:</p>
		
		<p>
			<img src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_action_stage.png" class="list">
			Stage a file change. <br>The equivalent to <span class="git">git add &lt;file&gt;</span>.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_action_unstage.png" class="list">
			Unstage a file. <br>The equivalent to <span class="git">git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;</span>. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<img src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_action_remove.png" class="list">

		</p>
		
		<h3 id="icons">File status icons</h3>
		
		<p>Files have different icons in front of them indicating their current status:</p>

		<p>In the commit dialog, verify which files are being committed and type your commit message. 
		When finished, press <em>commit</em> to commit your changes.</p>

		<p>The equivalent to <span class="git">git commit -m &lt;message&gt;</span>.</p>

		isn't possible to select another remote or refspec. Managing remotes and refspecs will be added 
		to Pocket Git in a future update.
